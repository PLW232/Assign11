<h1>Welcome to my boards page</h1>
"Percy's the name, designing this page is part of the game." <br>

Here you’ll find a couple of diagrammable images symbolizing it’s <br> complexity yet identical to one another. This illustration highlights a synonymous relationship between robotics, engineering and mechanical design.

<h2>Artifact 1</h2>
<p>This will talk about my first artifact</p>

<h2>Demonstrate embedded microprocessor system skills</h2>
<p>
Microprocessor system skills typically involve understanding how a microprocessor (or CPU) functions and interacts with other components in a system. This includes knowledge of digital logic design, microcontroller selection, schematic creation, printed circuit board layout and construction, and electromagnetic compatibility design.
