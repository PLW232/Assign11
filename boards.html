    <h3>
    <!-- Item 1 -->
    1. Design and complete robotic and embedded systems solutions that address real-world situations and challenges. <!-- Artifact 1 for objective 1--> <br> Artifact 1  <br> This will talk about my first artifact <br> <a href="#">Link to YouTube video</a> <br> <br>
    <!-- Item 2 -->
    2. Demonstrate embedded microprocessor system skills such as microcontroller selection, digital logic design, schematic creation, printed <br> circuit board layout and construction, electromagnetic compatibility design and manufacturing design. <br> 
    <p>
    Microprocessor system skills typically involve understanding how a microprocessor (or CPU) functions and interacts with other components in a system. This includes knowledge of digital logic design, <br> microcontroller selection, schematic creation, printed circuit board layout and construction, and electromagnetic compatibility design.
